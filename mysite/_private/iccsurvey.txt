the big comment - keep skaters at their level, competing at their level.  It is VERY obvious that some skaters are clearly competing below their skate abilities.  ISI is supposed to be a fun recreational event.  It did not happen to my daughter, but it sure was obvious as a spectator of a few other events."	"Submit"

I undersatnd that the environment in which your rink is in makes it hard to control people who are coming in and out.  However, the restrooms and the concession area were just horrible.  We were there the whole weekend and it honestly looked like the restrooms were never cleaned the entire time.  That being said the competion proably rates fair among othere in the area as well as prganziation both before and during the competition.

Everything ran so smoothly and we had a great time.  OUr coach has been doing it for years and it is a favorite of hersand now it has become our favorite.  Keep up the good work.  We will see you in November.  The only thing that I don't recall and think would be great is for group photos after results.  WE always get them at other competitons and I don't recall that being done last year.  It is so nice to have the group all together and it would be very nice for the 20th Anniversary.  We always buy that photo.  Thanks so much."	"Submit"
