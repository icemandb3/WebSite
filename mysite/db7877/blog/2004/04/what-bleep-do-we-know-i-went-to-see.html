          <div style="clear:both;"></div>What the Bleep Do We Know?<br /><br />I went to see a movie last night.  It was called <a href="http://www.whatthebleep.biz/">What the Bleep Do We Know?</a>.  Very Very Odd Film.<br /><br />For the past few weeks, the movie has been cropping up in people's conversations.  I began to get curious.  Then yesterday, I went to a pot luck for lunch and it was being discussed then.  <br /><br />I talked with my friends about visualization.  Visualization is something that business and sports people use to succeed.  It is the art of imagining oneself doing and succeeding at life.  For example, a woman wants to land her double axel (Figure Skating Jump).  She pictures in her mind's eye how she will go into the jump, using the information she received from her coach.  She will say this is where I will put my feet in this particular way and this is how my body will move to get a good start to the jump and so on.  She will practice the jump in her minds eye many times until it seems to get ingrained.  She will come to the side of the rink, picture it one more time, and then go out and do it.  As she does it, she will discard anything that would not fit what she is about to do.  Her foot is in the wrong spot, so she puts it into the right spot.  She is willing to discard that which does not fit, even if it is an ingrained habit.  As she lands it, she has successfully improved her abilities via imagination.<br /><br />In my life, I started work at an ice rink part time as a janitor.  I realized that I liked the people and the atmosphere where I worked and I wanted to do more.  I was part time and I wanted a full time job.  So I concentrated on doing my job very well.  I pictured myself getting and gaining skills and knowledge so that I would be indispensable to the owner.  I used this process in learning how to drive the Zamboni.  I became better with people, and dressed better.  I was open to learn how to lead people better.  I was open to do whatever was needed to become a full time rink manager even when it went against my own instincts.  My boss would frequently tell me how I had done something wrong and I would have to go out and fix the problem.  Before I visualized my success, I would not have been able to take the ego deflating move of undoing something I had done.  After a while, I learned what my boss wanted me to do.  Before you knew it, he was making space in the organization to fit me.  He let go three full time people and I replaced them.  Within a year, I was running the rink and the maintenance operation for an 85,000 sq ft building.  <br /><br />While visualization is a key, willingness is the other essential ingredient.  You have to be willing to let go and leave behind the parts that don't work.  For me, I let go of dressing poorly, bad manners, poor written skills, and being secure in my knowledge.  It is so important to be willing and open to different ways of doing things.  Most people can't change anything because they are too comfortable or in love with where and what they are.<br /><br />Have you ever spoken to a sculptor?  They always say that there is a major work of art inside the block of stone, and it is their job to remove the parts that don't fit.  They only leave behind what will be a part of the new whole.<br /><br />The spiritual principle of the movie is visualization as a means to changing our reality.  They are saying that our mental changes can change ourselves and those around us.  They discuss biochemical receptors.  <br /><br />The quantum mechanics parts of the movie were very accurate.  All about space and time, and sub molecular energy levels.  They didn't get into quarks, charm or love, but that was OK.  The biggest thing was the talk of how observers change events.<br /><br />They can to the conclusion that God exists and that there it is difficult to tell good from evil. <br /><br />A very well done romp through all manner of creation.<br /><br />Here is a movie review:<br /><a href="http://www.dtheatre.com/read.php?sid=2299&t=%3CB%3EReview%3A+What+the+Bleep+Do+We+Know%3F%3C%2Fb%3E">Movie Review</a><br /><br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><br />
