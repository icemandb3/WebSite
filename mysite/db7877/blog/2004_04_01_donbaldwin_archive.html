          <div style="clear:both;"></div>The importance of being humorous without picking on a group of people.<br /><br />The other day, my son and I were kidding around with imitating a gay voice complete with limp wrist body motions.  Some young girls we knew had wanted the voice.  They said my son did it better.  Sob!  We were trying to be satirical without singling out any one person.  We succeeded I felt.<br /><br />There was another person in the room.  She saw our behavior in a different way.  She saw me as a family leader dehumanizing a group of human beings who deserve to be treated respectfully.  That seemed really serious and kind of heavy.  She went on to tell me of her past in dealing with various wonderful people in her life that were also homosexual.  She was really sensitive to how they feel.  I immediately apologized because my choice of humor had upset her.  I didn't think that was fair.  I felt that I was taking a group of people and diminishing them.  That is unacceptable.  My being a leader of a family was making it worse.<br /><br />Heavy load.<br /><br />On Tuesday, I was talking to a friend who was remembering the days of desegregation.  I remembered them too, but from an opposite outlook.  He was also remembering how a man at work changed what he was saying due to seeing people with color in a room.  I asked him if he felt like he was being diminished when that was going on.  He agreed and said it made him feel less than.  I think that kind of thing makes a person feel really small and for no good reason.  We are all children of God and as such we are really similar.  <br /><br />So what can I do now?  I have to look at my humor in a different way.  I need to be less singling out of particular ethnic, religious or sexual preferences.  I know I am not going to be prefect at that.  I need to do the best I can though.  I will listen to the people around me to see when I make the mistakes.  And when I do make a mistake, I will apologize.  I am getting better at following better thought patterns.  Once again progress rather than perfection.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><br />

          <div style="clear:both;"></div>What the Bleep Do We Know?<br /><br />I went to see a movie last night.  It was called <a href="http://www.whatthebleep.biz/">What the Bleep Do We Know?</a>.  Very Very Odd Film.<br /><br />For the past few weeks, the movie has been cropping up in people's conversations.  I began to get curious.  Then yesterday, I went to a pot luck for lunch and it was being discussed then.  <br /><br />I talked with my friends about visualization.  Visualization is something that business and sports people use to succeed.  It is the art of imagining oneself doing and succeeding at life.  For example, a woman wants to land her double axel (Figure Skating Jump).  She pictures in her mind's eye how she will go into the jump, using the information she received from her coach.  She will say this is where I will put my feet in this particular way and this is how my body will move to get a good start to the jump and so on.  She will practice the jump in her minds eye many times until it seems to get ingrained.  She will come to the side of the rink, picture it one more time, and then go out and do it.  As she does it, she will discard anything that would not fit what she is about to do.  Her foot is in the wrong spot, so she puts it into the right spot.  She is willing to discard that which does not fit, even if it is an ingrained habit.  As she lands it, she has successfully improved her abilities via imagination.<br /><br />In my life, I started work at an ice rink part time as a janitor.  I realized that I liked the people and the atmosphere where I worked and I wanted to do more.  I was part time and I wanted a full time job.  So I concentrated on doing my job very well.  I pictured myself getting and gaining skills and knowledge so that I would be indispensable to the owner.  I used this process in learning how to drive the Zamboni.  I became better with people, and dressed better.  I was open to learn how to lead people better.  I was open to do whatever was needed to become a full time rink manager even when it went against my own instincts.  My boss would frequently tell me how I had done something wrong and I would have to go out and fix the problem.  Before I visualized my success, I would not have been able to take the ego deflating move of undoing something I had done.  After a while, I learned what my boss wanted me to do.  Before you knew it, he was making space in the organization to fit me.  He let go three full time people and I replaced them.  Within a year, I was running the rink and the maintenance operation for an 85,000 sq ft building.  <br /><br />While visualization is a key, willingness is the other essential ingredient.  You have to be willing to let go and leave behind the parts that don't work.  For me, I let go of dressing poorly, bad manners, poor written skills, and being secure in my knowledge.  It is so important to be willing and open to different ways of doing things.  Most people can't change anything because they are too comfortable or in love with where and what they are.<br /><br />Have you ever spoken to a sculptor?  They always say that there is a major work of art inside the block of stone, and it is their job to remove the parts that don't fit.  They only leave behind what will be a part of the new whole.<br /><br />The spiritual principle of the movie is visualization as a means to changing our reality.  They are saying that our mental changes can change ourselves and those around us.  They discuss biochemical receptors.  <br /><br />The quantum mechanics parts of the movie were very accurate.  All about space and time, and sub molecular energy levels.  They didn't get into quarks, charm or love, but that was OK.  The biggest thing was the talk of how observers change events.<br /><br />They can to the conclusion that God exists and that there it is difficult to tell good from evil. <br /><br />A very well done romp through all manner of creation.<br /><br />Here is a movie review:<br /><a href="http://www.dtheatre.com/read.php?sid=2299&t=%3CB%3EReview%3A+What+the+Bleep+Do+We+Know%3F%3C%2Fb%3E">Movie Review</a><br /><br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><br />

          <div style="clear:both;"></div>Seder<br /><br />Today I spent about 6 hours tracking down the last of the supplies for the Seder tomorrow.  <br /><br />I suppose a really Jewish person would look at our Christian ceremony as a suspicious travesty of a sacred Jewish ritual.  I hope, though, that a Messianic Jew would look at it as a good adaptation of a ceremony made meaningless by the coming of Jesus.<br /><br />I think there is so much Christians can learn from Jewish ceremonies.  Our current religious holidays are adaptations of Roman pagan rites.  Christmas is Winter Solstice.  We know when Easter is by Luke 22's writing on the last supper.  The Assumption and many other rites are based on dates assigned by the Emperor Constantine's mother in the 4th century AD.  <br /><br />At the same time I learn from the Jewish ceremonies, I am so glad I am not Jewish.  The rites are really complicated.  We Christians just pray to God and Jesus.  We know they/he are there.  They talk to us in varous ways and I am happy with the way my world is.  The Jewish cremonies are so ritualistic.  You need to assemble a lot of stage props.  <br /><br />I think that the stage props date from before the time of TV.  You had to provide your own multimedia learning.  Today, we put in a tape.  In Biblical times, people had to live and experience things in all five senses.  With that in mind, it makes sense that there were so many rituals with books to direct the celebrants in how to have them.  Seder is all about teaching the next generation about the Exodus.  I wonder if this is one of the ways the Bible was originally handed down from father to son.<br /><br />I will write more on our experiences tomorrow night.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><br />

          <div style="clear:both;"></div>Job<br /><br />I am one of the 92% of lucky people to have a job.  While I have my job, I do not own my job.  Once I owned a job and it didn't last long.  I did everything my way, not the bosses' way and that didn't work out very well at all.  Today I have the attitude that I am able to have my job today based on my performance.  If I do a good job today, I am priveledged to be invited back tomorrow.  This has lasted almost 13 years now.  <br /><br />I also try to be grateful I have a job.  I am glad to show up and do what is required.  Sometimes I do not like what I have to do and sometimes I would not do the things on my own, but I have to let go and follow my bosses' lead.  I guess it is a different kind of higher power.  <br /><br />When I talk to people, I tell them who I am.  I tell them I write and I take pictures and I like to help addicts.  Sometimes they ask what I do for a living and I am happy to tell them.  Back in the past, I was a manager and a business owner and I would tell people I was Don the Manager, or Don the owner.  Today I live life in surround sound and 3 D rather than flat.  While those job things are important, it is me as a person who is more important.<br /><br />I don't know what I am going to do when I leave my current job.  Every job has an end, and hopefully I will keep going.  I am not highly educated so the doors will not open magically the way they do for college graduates.  I think I will rely on God to get me my next job.  No matter what I lose in life, if I am meant to have it, God will get me another one.<br /><br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><br />

          <div style="clear:both;"></div>Solution<br /><br />Every day when I wake up I have choices.  Will I live in problems or will I live in solutions.  <br /><br />I pray to God and he usually gives me strength to allow him to make the major decisions in my life.  But always there are problems and little things going wrong.  If I sit around and complain about it, it just gets worse.  If I ask God for solutions and start living in the solution, things go better.<br /><br />Today when I went into work, I had a sudden urge to ask for two days of vacation starting tomorrow.  Never mind that the rule is that I have to request two weeks in advance, I wanted them now.  I called the human resources department.  The lady there told me she would have to talk to the owner to get an exception.  I suddenly remembered how I felt when one of my people wanted four days off by surprize.  I was upset and angry.  I felt betrayed by that person's lack of courtesy to even give me adequate notice.  As it worked out, it was OK, but it still felt rough.  I told the human resources lady that it was OK, I didn't want the time as badly as that.  <br /><br />In the past I would have been upset and grumbly for the whole rest of the day.  I would have been miserable and let my upsetness get out sideways.  I would get angry at things that weren't mine to be angry about, or things that didn't make me angry in the past.  Today, I decided to live in the solution.  I decided that I didn't need the owner upset at me and that I could find other ways to solve my time issues.<br /><br />It is sometimes difficult to remember that First Things First.  Job is a First Thing and the relations with the people around me is job 1.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><br />

          <div style="clear:both;"></div>Turning defects into strengths.<br /><br />We are all handed a tough row to hoe.  We are born, we live, we die.  There is no operator's manual on any of us.  I think it would all be so much easier if God sent a little cheat book with us.  For some reason, God has created us all differently.  So we all have similar defects displayed differently.  I think this may be a part of God's humor.<br /><br />As we go through life, we need to be sensitive to the pattern of events that occur.  If a person gets mad at his/her mother and then goes on a vandalism binge on a regular basis, I would have to say that person has a problem with something in his/her mother.  Or if a person always winds up performing the same sin, I would say that person is starting a pattern.  <br /><br />So what can be done to turn a defect into a strength?<br /><br />About the only method I know is to surrender.  A person needs to give up, but more importantly, give it all up to God.  Surrender is the only method that works.  If I fight a sin in my life, I get to repeat it.  Granted, it may take a while to repeat it, but nonetheless, it will happen.  When I give up, I am allowing God into my life.  Once God gets involved, then I have a chance of being cured of the defect.  I could fight it, but that method leads to insanity.  <br /><br />Once I am aware of a sin, it is so much easier to avoid it.  Sometimes it is such a difficult sin, God has to intervene so I don't do it again.  No matter how you cut it, I have no effectiveness against my sins.  Only God does.<br /><br />It reminds me of the elephant in the living room.  One day, a man went into his living room.  He squeezed to one side, walked leaning on the walls and then went through to the next room.  He did this for thirty years.  He never thought it was odd.  One day, he went into his living room when his friend was there.  His friend pointed out that he was walking oddly because of the elephant in the middle of his living room.  Suddenly, he saw it.  He stopped, he prayed to God to remove it.  God didn't do anything right away, but he did teach the man how to walk around it.  After a while longer, God taught the man how to stop feeding it.  Once he stopped feeding it, it got smaller and smaller.  One day, all that was left was the worn parts of the carpet where the man had walked around the huge beast.  He stood up, breathed a deep sigh of relief and thanked God for removing the elephant in his living room.  He realized he felt better now and went on with his life.  The elephant is our defects and our sins.<br /><br />Have you come to believe that a power greater than yours can restore you to sanity?<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><br />

          <div style="clear:both;"></div>Yesterday's word is Complacency<br /><br />Complacency is all about perfection.  Perfection is a bad place to be.  It means that a person is done growing.  Once someone is done growing it seems like they are all about death.  Death is the only time that we finish growing.<br /><br />A friend of mine has been sober for fifteen years.  One day he decided he hated everyone in his community.  And worse yet, he decided that everyone hated him.  At the same time, he decided that God is done with him.  That God no longer had any more changes to make in him.  He used to be a pretty happy guy.  The other day, he was telling me about how his job isn't going well and it was time to commit suicide.  Hmmmm.......  But this is the man with the perfect life, the man who God has finished, the man who hates his community and himself.  A significant change.  For now, nothing is possible for him.   Hope is gone.  He is unteachable.  He is done changing and growing.  <br /><br />When I do something perfectly, I am not allowing myself any room to change or to get better.  I am also almost always putting myself on a pedestal.  When I get to thinking how good I am at something, I always let it go to my head.  I am not a pleasant person to be near when my ego rears it's ugly head.  I get controlling, vengeful, angry, and insensitive to others needs.  <br /><br />I find it hard to accept other's compliments.  I am always worried that it will get to my head and that whatever they are talking about I will no longer have a need to work on.  I am waiting for ego to rear it's ugly self.<br /><br />A friend of mine is talent in the entertainment industry.  He said that one day it suddenly occured to him that his job was all about his ego.  I think a talent job is very destructive to our innermost selves.  If I had talent in something, then I would be way too good at it and I would never be open to better ways of doing it.<br /><br />I have been in the same job for six years.  I have kept my job by always being ready to try something new.  Just because something didn't work last year does not always mean it will not work this year.  It is so crucial to always try things, sometimes with only minor changes.  The minor changes are sometimes the ones that count.  Most people in my job only last a year or two.<br /><br />Complacency is something that can lead to death.  It definitely always leads to spiritual death.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><br />
