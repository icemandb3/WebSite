          <div style="clear:both;"></div>Acceptance<br /><br />It is so hard to accept who and what I am.  But at the same time, without acceptance, I can not reach a conscious contact with God.  Once again, if I surrender I win.  <br /><br />In the serenity prayer, it talks about how we need to accept the things we can not change.  Those things are people, places and things.  Really, the only thing we can change is ourselves and how we deal with situations.  <br /><br />No what happens in my life I wind up having to accept who and where I am.  Right now, life is good and easy to accept.  You never know when things will change though.  And if they do change, I have to accept the changes.<br /><br />Isn't it easy to accept the weather?  No matter what is going on outside, I know I can not change it so it is easy to have serenity about weather.  Sometimes, like when we have an ice storm, I do not like the weather.  No one ever said that acceptance is the same as like or dislike.  I have an ankle that has arthritis.  Sometimes it doesn't work when I wake up.  I don't like it, but I accept it.  Some days I wonder what God wants me to learn from the gift of arthritis.  Most of the time, I am grateful because I don't need a cane and it does start to work after a while.<br /><br />Once we have come to believe that a power greater than us is all that can save our lives, we have to accept the damage we have done.  Just because we regret the past and make amends for it does not mean that we can change the past nor erase the damage we have caused.  God will always forgive us.  It is the rest of the world that is sometimes the problem.  When I got divorced, I found that I couldn't put things back together again.  It is really like Humpty Dumpty.  All the Kings horses and all the Kings Men couldn't put him back together again.  <br /><br />When I was first sober, I was too accepting.  Afterwards, I realized I let a lot of people walk over me.  I felt like a door mat.  People, especially at work, would make demands and too easily I would give into them.  I was accepting that I was a bad person for my driniking and I was not accepting that I was being taken advantage of.  I don't like being a door mat.<br /><br />It is so crucial to have a balance in life.  But if I had good balance, I never would have needed to examine my spiritual life.  I would never have received God.  So where do I draw the line of acceptance?  It is different every day.  Somedays I mess it up and I have to make amends for mistakes.  I find a period of prayer and mediation will help me see where I  need to be on a particular issue.  <br /><br />No matter what, I try to make progress on acceptance.  I know I will not always get it right, but that is OK.  My life is all about progress, not perfection.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><br />

          <div style="clear:both;"></div>Finally!  <br /><br />The prepartory work for the Christian Seder is done!  A very good resource is:<br /><a href="http://www.cresourcei.org/haggadah.html">Christian Haggadah</a><br />And to find out more about Passover, here is another:<br /><a href="http://www.cresourcei.org/seder.html">Christian Passover</a><br /><br />Now we have lists and a plan for the ceremony.  I called the House Person and she is excited to have this go on at our Home Church.  <br /><br />Now I will feel like I am the profesisonal shopper.  I will have to hunt down all the things on the list so we will have a good seder.  I am looking forward to our celebration.  I will feel free when it is finally done.  It seems like a  lot to do, but worth it in the end.  I am looking forward to a spiritual time when God's presence will be felt strongly.<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><br />

          <div style="clear:both;"></div>Today's word is Community.<br /><br />Community is what gets me going on my spiritual trips.  My sense of community enhances my connection with God.  My community gets me going on the right track when I stray too.<br /><br />Last Tuesday, Pastor Jerry called.  I have political differences witht the head pastor at his church so I no longer go.  For the past two years I have participated in Pastor Jerry's Wednesday 6 am small group.  Six to ten men meet each week.  We have breakfast with a liberal serving of God, God's word, accountability and fellowship.  I like the group a lot and have missed it in my life since my schism with his church.  Jerry challenged me to come again.  When I examined my motives it seemed like a bad idea not to go.  I went and enjoyed reconnecting with my small community of believers.<br /><br />Today, I went to a morning meeting of my 12 step program.  I went to breakfast with about a dozen other people involved in the groups.  I sat at the table with a man with eight years, one with a few months, one with sixty days and me with 5 years.  All of us came from vastly different walks of life, and yet we had one thing in common.  We are all trying to get closer to a God of our understanding.  Because of that and our common history of abuse, we had a really good time.  We wound up teaching the new men a few things about how we live life and they, by their presence, taught us how to remember where we used to be.  We discussed the difference between religion and spirituality, how to live life imperfectly and above all how to love.  It was really good for all of us.  We helped each other on the path towards God. and that is always good.<br /><br />The passover dinner at my home church seemed to be a really big project.  I asked a friend of mine to team up with me on it.  When she wrote me back, I could tell I was bringing joy and enthusiasm into her life.  She is ready and more than ready to work for our common goal of commenorating Christ's last dinner.  <br /><br />I really like my Home Church.  It is 8 to 10 married believers, mainly in their thirties.  I love listening to them teach and learn.  Sometimes I have something good to share too.  All of us help each other on the path towards God.  I am sure the Seder based refreshments will go very well.<br /><br />My assistant at work had a group of 15 or so of us over last Saturday night.  We all played cards.  We fellowshipped.  I realized I have been there long enough for everyone to be family as well as co workers.  I have watched a lot of kids grow up.  It is good when you have times of togetherness.  The people I work with sometimes have really good insights into where I have to do better as a person.  This community helps me as well.<br /><br />During the summer, I see a lot of t shirts that talk about a village raising a child.  We all need tribes and communities to help raise us as spiritually sensitive beings.  My community helps me a lot.<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><br />

          <div style="clear:both;"></div>I just realized it!  I am making refreshments for a Christian Group on April 6.  That is the second day of passover, and it is the time that Jesus celebrated His Last Supper.  I don't think buying a few cupcakes are going to do it this time.  Fortunately, I found a few sites to help me out:<br /><a href="http://www.holidays.net/passover/">Passover</a><br /><a href="http://www.christianseder.com/">Christian Seder</a><br /><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bparnes/HAGGADAH/seder.html">Haggadah or order of sevice</a><br /><br />So what to do now...  Looks like a lot to do.  <div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><br />
