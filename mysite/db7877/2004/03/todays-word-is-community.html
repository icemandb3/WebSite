          <div style="clear:both;"></div>Today's word is Community.<br /><br />Community is what gets me going on my spiritual trips.  My sense of community enhances my connection with God.  My community gets me going on the right track when I stray too.<br /><br />Last Tuesday, Pastor Jerry called.  I have political differences witht the head pastor at his church so I no longer go.  For the past two years I have participated in Pastor Jerry's Wednesday 6 am small group.  Six to ten men meet each week.  We have breakfast with a liberal serving of God, God's word, accountability and fellowship.  I like the group a lot and have missed it in my life since my schism with his church.  Jerry challenged me to come again.  When I examined my motives it seemed like a bad idea not to go.  I went and enjoyed reconnecting with my small community of believers.<br /><br />Today, I went to a morning meeting of my 12 step program.  I went to breakfast with about a dozen other people involved in the groups.  I sat at the table with a man with eight years, one with a few months, one with sixty days and me with 5 years.  All of us came from vastly different walks of life, and yet we had one thing in common.  We are all trying to get closer to a God of our understanding.  Because of that and our common history of abuse, we had a really good time.  We wound up teaching the new men a few things about how we live life and they, by their presence, taught us how to remember where we used to be.  We discussed the difference between religion and spirituality, how to live life imperfectly and above all how to love.  It was really good for all of us.  We helped each other on the path towards God. and that is always good.<br /><br />The passover dinner at my home church seemed to be a really big project.  I asked a friend of mine to team up with me on it.  When she wrote me back, I could tell I was bringing joy and enthusiasm into her life.  She is ready and more than ready to work for our common goal of commenorating Christ's last dinner.  <br /><br />I really like my Home Church.  It is 8 to 10 married believers, mainly in their thirties.  I love listening to them teach and learn.  Sometimes I have something good to share too.  All of us help each other on the path towards God.  I am sure the Seder based refreshments will go very well.<br /><br />My assistant at work had a group of 15 or so of us over last Saturday night.  We all played cards.  We fellowshipped.  I realized I have been there long enough for everyone to be family as well as co workers.  I have watched a lot of kids grow up.  It is good when you have times of togetherness.  The people I work with sometimes have really good insights into where I have to do better as a person.  This community helps me as well.<br /><br />During the summer, I see a lot of t shirts that talk about a village raising a child.  We all need tribes and communities to help raise us as spiritually sensitive beings.  My community helps me a lot.<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><br />
