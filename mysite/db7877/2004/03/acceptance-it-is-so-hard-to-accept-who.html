          <div style="clear:both;"></div>Acceptance<br /><br />It is so hard to accept who and what I am.  But at the same time, without acceptance, I can not reach a conscious contact with God.  Once again, if I surrender I win.  <br /><br />In the serenity prayer, it talks about how we need to accept the things we can not change.  Those things are people, places and things.  Really, the only thing we can change is ourselves and how we deal with situations.  <br /><br />No what happens in my life I wind up having to accept who and where I am.  Right now, life is good and easy to accept.  You never know when things will change though.  And if they do change, I have to accept the changes.<br /><br />Isn't it easy to accept the weather?  No matter what is going on outside, I know I can not change it so it is easy to have serenity about weather.  Sometimes, like when we have an ice storm, I do not like the weather.  No one ever said that acceptance is the same as like or dislike.  I have an ankle that has arthritis.  Sometimes it doesn't work when I wake up.  I don't like it, but I accept it.  Some days I wonder what God wants me to learn from the gift of arthritis.  Most of the time, I am grateful because I don't need a cane and it does start to work after a while.<br /><br />Once we have come to believe that a power greater than us is all that can save our lives, we have to accept the damage we have done.  Just because we regret the past and make amends for it does not mean that we can change the past nor erase the damage we have caused.  God will always forgive us.  It is the rest of the world that is sometimes the problem.  When I got divorced, I found that I couldn't put things back together again.  It is really like Humpty Dumpty.  All the Kings horses and all the Kings Men couldn't put him back together again.  <br /><br />When I was first sober, I was too accepting.  Afterwards, I realized I let a lot of people walk over me.  I felt like a door mat.  People, especially at work, would make demands and too easily I would give into them.  I was accepting that I was a bad person for my driniking and I was not accepting that I was being taken advantage of.  I don't like being a door mat.<br /><br />It is so crucial to have a balance in life.  But if I had good balance, I never would have needed to examine my spiritual life.  I would never have received God.  So where do I draw the line of acceptance?  It is different every day.  Somedays I mess it up and I have to make amends for mistakes.  I find a period of prayer and mediation will help me see where I  need to be on a particular issue.  <br /><br />No matter what, I try to make progress on acceptance.  I know I will not always get it right, but that is OK.  My life is all about progress, not perfection.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><br />
