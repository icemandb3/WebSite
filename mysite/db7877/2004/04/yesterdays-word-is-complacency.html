          <div style="clear:both;"></div>Yesterday's word is Complacency<br /><br />Complacency is all about perfection.  Perfection is a bad place to be.  It means that a person is done growing.  Once someone is done growing it seems like they are all about death.  Death is the only time that we finish growing.<br /><br />A friend of mine has been sober for fifteen years.  One day he decided he hated everyone in his community.  And worse yet, he decided that everyone hated him.  At the same time, he decided that God is done with him.  That God no longer had any more changes to make in him.  He used to be a pretty happy guy.  The other day, he was telling me about how his job isn't going well and it was time to commit suicide.  Hmmmm.......  But this is the man with the perfect life, the man who God has finished, the man who hates his community and himself.  A significant change.  For now, nothing is possible for him.   Hope is gone.  He is unteachable.  He is done changing and growing.  <br /><br />When I do something perfectly, I am not allowing myself any room to change or to get better.  I am also almost always putting myself on a pedestal.  When I get to thinking how good I am at something, I always let it go to my head.  I am not a pleasant person to be near when my ego rears it's ugly head.  I get controlling, vengeful, angry, and insensitive to others needs.  <br /><br />I find it hard to accept other's compliments.  I am always worried that it will get to my head and that whatever they are talking about I will no longer have a need to work on.  I am waiting for ego to rear it's ugly self.<br /><br />A friend of mine is talent in the entertainment industry.  He said that one day it suddenly occured to him that his job was all about his ego.  I think a talent job is very destructive to our innermost selves.  If I had talent in something, then I would be way too good at it and I would never be open to better ways of doing it.<br /><br />I have been in the same job for six years.  I have kept my job by always being ready to try something new.  Just because something didn't work last year does not always mean it will not work this year.  It is so crucial to always try things, sometimes with only minor changes.  The minor changes are sometimes the ones that count.  Most people in my job only last a year or two.<br /><br />Complacency is something that can lead to death.  It definitely always leads to spiritual death.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><br />
